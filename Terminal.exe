What does the man command do? Type in man rm. How do you scroll and get out? The man command lists the manual for a command
- D or Control ⌃-D to advance half a page - B or Control ⌃-B to go back one page - U or Control ⌃-U to go back half a page
Look at the man page for ls. What does the -l flag do? What does the
-a flag -do? The `-l` flag lists files in a list format with more detail and the `-a` lists all files and folders including hidden ones

How do you jump between words in the terminal? option left/right
How do you get to the end of a line in terminal? control + e
How do you move your cursor to the beginning in terminal? control + a
How do you delete a word (without pressing backspace multiple times) in -terminal? option + delete

What is the difference between a terminal and shell? The terminal is a program is just an interface to the shell. The shell is what actually handles commands and so forth; the terminal program just gives it a way to interact with the environment.
What is an absolute path? An absolute path is a path that starts from the root route and gives the complete location for a file or folder
What is an relative path? A relative path is a path that starts at the current location and not the root route
What is a flag? Give three examples of flags you have used. A flag adds additional functionality to an existing command, we have seen -a and -l for the ls command and -r for the cp and rm commands
What do the r and f flags do with the rm command? r will remove folders and recursively go through each folder and file and f will force removal
